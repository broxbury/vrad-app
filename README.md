When a user arrives at the Login page, they are greeted with a sign-in form. A username, email, and reason for visit are all required fields. 

Once the user signs in, they are greeted with options to explore each listed neighborhood. They are also shown a brief description of each area. 

### Selecting An Area And Single Listing

When the user selects a neighborhood, they are taken to a page that will display all of the available listings for that area. 

## More App Navigation Movement

While navigating listings, a user may also "Favorite" a listing, which will save that listing for later. 

If a user wishes to see their "Favorited" listings, they can do so by clicking the "Favorites" button in the top left corner of the application.

Finally, when a user is finished navigating the site, they can sign-out from any page. 


## Additional Info
This project was created using a mixture of class-based and functional Components in React. Browser Router was used for routing/navigation, and all data is being retrieved using asynchronous fetch calls within our Components. 

We also implemented Unit and/or Integration tests for all of our components, so feel free to dive into our testing suite to feel your way around the codebase!

## Challenges 
This project was challenging for us on a few different levels. This was our first project using Browser Router, and while challenging at first, we were able to successfully implement the tool into our project. Another 'road-block' was writing asynchronous network requests, and then subsequently testing those succesfully by mocking out the requests.
